<h5>The policy for this test</h5>
<p>This test uses the <a
href="http://www.norid.no/regelverk/vedlegg-f.en.html">domain policy</a>
of Norid when doing a domain check. This means that the check will
result in an <span class="error">error</span> if one or more of these
requirements fail. The check can also result in one or more warnings. A
<span class="warning">warning</span> dictates that the name server
configuration differs in what Norid currently recommends.</p>
Below are the main technical name server requirements summarized:
<ol>
 <li>At least two separate name servers</li>
 <li>Consistency between data in the domain name application and response from name servers</li>
 <li>Authoritative name servers</li>
 <li>Accessible name servers</li>
 <li>Correct email information in the SOA (Start Of Authority) record</li>
 <li>Consistent serial number in the SOA record</li>
 <li>Canonical name on the right-hand side in NS and MX records</li>
 <li>No IDN domain names in the host address</li>
</ol>

<h5>The backbone of this test is using DNSCheck</h5>
<p>DNSCheck is a program that was designed to help people check, measure
and hopefully also understand the workings of the Domain Name System,
DNS. DNSCheck was created for .SE - The Internet Infrastructure
Foundation. The source code for DNSCheck can be viewed <a
href="https://github.com/dotse/dnscheck/">on Github</a></p>
<p>When a domain
(aka zone) is submitted to DNSCheck it will investigate the domain's
general health by traversing the DNS from root (.) to the TLD (Top Level
Domain, like .SE) to eventually the name server(s) that holds the
information about the specified domain (like iis.se). Some other sanity
checks, for example measuring host connectivity, validity of
IP-addresses and control of DNSSEC signatures will also be
performed.</p>

<h5>About the domain name system, DNS</h5> 
<p>The domain name system (DNS in short) is what could be
called the "phone book" of the Internet. It keeps track of the mapping
of, for example, a human-readable website name (like www.iis.se) to the
slightly more arcane form of an IP-address that the computer needs to
initiate communication (in this case 212.247.7.229).</p>

<p>Besides browsing the Internet with your web browser using website
names instead of IP-addresses the DNS also makes sure your emails find
their way. In short, a stable DNS is vital for most companies to
maintain a working and efficient operation.</p>
